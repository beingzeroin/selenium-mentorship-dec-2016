DSL - Domain Specific Language


Seleniun Independent
Domain Specific
Maintainable
Junior members in the team can work on test case automation
Senior members can maintain framework.
Automation becomes faster

TEST CASES ARE LIGHTWEIGHT, FRAMEWORK (All heavylifting)

class PageOnSite
{
    // Data members

    // Functions

    // MoveToAnotherPage by clicking a link
    // Enroll

    // each action should be a function/method
    // considering inputs and output

}


// CLARITY  
PRIYA - CONFIDENCE
RV - ARTICULATION or COMMUNICATION
PV - KNOWLEDGE 
SH - CANDID and HONEST


this - used inside functions of a class.
It is used to access members of the class.
It represents current object.

super is same as this, but it can call members of superclass.


Class for a Page (Extend from BasePage)
    - WebDriver as data member
    - Constructor (default)
    - Constructor (parameterized WebDriver)


Framework / Library
    - Library - JARS which we can use.

TestNG is an execution fraemwork
    - PRovides a way to write tests.
    - Provides a way to execute them.
    - Creates Report.


Logger
    - Why Need it?
    - What is it?
    - How to use it?


System.out.println - Logging the message!
    - Logging only to console window (Persistence)
    - Logging Levels (Configurable to which level to log).


abstract class Logger
{
    // Only for you
    public abstract void logDebug(String message);

    // Only what is relevent
    public abstract void logInfo(String message);

    // We observe something suspicious
    // But we can ignore it for the time being
    public abstract void logWarn(String message);

    // Validating username ---- Something worth noticiing
    public abstract void logError(String message);

    // FATAL test failing or assertion failing
    public abstract void logFatal(String message);

    public abstract void setLoggingLevel(int level);

    // 0 - DEBUG, 1 - INFO, 2 - WARN, 3 - ERROR, 4 - FATAL

}

ABSTRACTION
    - abstract class BasePage


INHERTIANCE
    - BasePage (Code ReUse and avoid code duplication)

ENCAPSULATION
    - Hide the unnecessary details from consumers of our classes.
    - protected (Tests should not use driver directly. Restrict it.)
    - private (Logger)


POLYMORPHISM
    - Overloading (Constructor in POM) - Give us a choice.

Difference between ABSTRACT class and Interface!!!


API Testing
 - SOAP UI

 WEB APP - WEB SERVER

 WebApp  ----                   Calls an API    -----              APP SERVER (Functions)

 Desktop App --

 Mobile App

 RESTAssure


WebServices --- XML - MS
REST is new way of writing web services which is called API (JSON)
